Secondly, The "sweet" document contains a collection of delicious treats. Each has a unique identifier, name, price, type, and description. thirdly The "drink" document contains a collection of beverages. Each beverage has a unique identifier, name, price, type, and description. lastly The "cardInfo" document contains a collection of credit card profiles with card numbers, card types, cardholder names, CVC codes, and expiration dates.
